Coding best practices (By Victor):

I'm using Atom code editor, and I recommend you do the same.

Make sure you use the following linters with the code editor:
-linter-pep8 as the styling standard
-linter-pylint to veryfiy python makes sense

There are also some useful packages to use with Atom tha makes coding a lot easier:
-python-tools is self explanatory
-atom-django to auto complete django functions
-django-templates to help with django html templates

Have a look around Atom's package manager, there's a lot of cool stuff
